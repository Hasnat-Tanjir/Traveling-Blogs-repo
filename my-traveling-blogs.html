            <h1>Welcome to my Travelling Blogs!!</h1>
            <h2>The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.</h2> <br> <br>
            
            <h2 class="blog-title">1. Anywhere We Roam</h2>
            <img src="p1.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="about">
                <br> <b>What I love about it:</b> <span class="highlight">Anywhere We Roam</span> may seem like a typical clean and minimal travel blog but this UK-based travel blog runs by Paul and Mark is a great example of how photos speaks a thousand words. <br>
                <br>
                The layout of the travel blog merely serves as a white canvas to emphasize the atmospheric and immersive photography that Anywhere We Roam is a master at. Their photography and writings are top-notch and has the ability to transport you to the location in question. <br>
                <br>
                A great example of this can be seen on articles like <span class="highlight">Impressions of Havana - A story from the streets</span> where the duo takes you through the street of Havana exploring its culture and vibe through atmospheric photography and immersive writing that will make you feel like you are there yourself. <br> <br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">2. Maptia</h2>
            <img src="p2.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="about">
                <br> <b>What I love about it:</b> As you know, I am a sucker for a well-designed website and one of the travel platform that have always been on my radar is <span class="highlight">Maptia</span>, a platform for travelers and explorers to document and capture the world around them. <br> <br>

                <span class="highlight">Maptia</span> has not been updating as regularly as I had hope for but even then, the design they had come up with years ago is timeless and still stand as one of the best well-designed travel websites out there. <br> <br>

                Its focus on world-changing photography accompanying the travel stories written by those who have lived their lives to the fullest is the sole reason why <span class="highlight">Maptia</span> deserve a spot on this list. <br> <br>

                <span>The Gathering of Giants</span> travel story by Tony Wu is an excellent example of Maptia's superior content that you can't get from any where else. Seeing the extremely detailed photos and reading the well-written story on this article is as close as you can get to being near these beautiful stunning whales. <br> <br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">3. IFLY Magazine</h2>
            <img src="p3.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="about">
                <br> <b>What I love about it:</b> I first discovered about <span class="highlight">IFLY Magazine</span> when I flew with KLM to Europe in 2018 and as they often send out newsletters to their fliers featuring several locations for them to travel to next, they introduced me to IFLY. <br> <br>

                <span class="highlight">IFLY Magazine</span> is an online travel magazine operated by the Dutch Airlines, KLM, that combines the professionally shot photographs you often come to expect from travel magazines on an airplane, the use of interactive media such as sound and videos, and travel tips and tricks that are universally useful to all types of travelers. <br> <br>

                A great example of how IFLY excels at storytelling is in <span class="highlight">"The Wales Way"</span> article. The article highlights a road trip itinerary that take us through the beautiful sceneries of Wales. <br> <br>

                The moment you arrive on that page, you will see a full-screen video of drones flying around Wales together with many full-page photos of mountains and castles of Wales. If that doesn't create the best first impression for a travel website, I do not know what is. <br> <br>
